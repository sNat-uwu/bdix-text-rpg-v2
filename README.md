# bdix-text-rpg-v2
very basic text rpg im working on to practice my java SKILLZ over the summer.
## install&run
if on linux(or osx) running bash  you can
1. run the build.sh script
2. run the run.sh script

if on windows you will have to manually compile the source and run the "Main" class.

## update script
if you cloned the repository the update script might work to automate pulling. it's pretty useless because it's a one line command but i just wanted to fuck around with some shell scripts a lil more.
